PROPOSED : Incidence of exposure to drugs for which pre-emptive pharmacogenomic testing is available

The goal of this PROPOSED study is to derive data that large
healthcare organizations can combine data on risks of adverse events
and cost data to conduct cost-effectiveness / cost-benefit analyses
for pre-emptive pharmacogenomics testing.  Detailed information and
protocol is available on the [OHDSI
Wiki](http://www.ohdsi.org/web/wiki/doku.php?id=research:project_proposal_template).

Project layout:
- dummy-tables-for-incidence-of-exposure-to-PGx-drugs.xlsx : Table shells for the study

- sql : SQL code for the study that has been tested on the Truven MDCD, MDCR, and CCAE datasets in CDM v4 hosted by IMEDS 

- R code : currently empty but will likely hold the script to execute the SQL code at each participating site

- man : currently empty
