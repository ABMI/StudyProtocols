Comparison of Canagliflozin vs. Alternative Antihyperglycemic Treatments
========================================================================
**on Risk of Heart Failure Hospitalization and Amputation for Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and the Subpopulation with Established Cardiovascular Disease**

Recent studies have suggested that SGLT2 inhibitors may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, relative to placebo, and SGLT2i drugs may lower risk of hospitalization for heart failure and all-cause mortality relative to other glucose lowering drugs. However, there are limited head-to-head comparisons that provide a real-world perspective of the safety and effectiveness of canagliflozin relative to other drugs in the SGLT2i class or alternative therapies. This study aims to examine the comparative effects of canagliflozin vs. other alternative treatments for T2DM, overall and within the subpopulation of patients with established cardiovascular diseases, across 4 US administrative claims databases. We will study 2 health outcomes {1) hospitalization for heart failure, and 2) below knee lower extremity amputation }, amongst new users of canagliflozin vs. new users of {1) empagliflozin, 2) dapagliflozin, 3) empagliflozin or dapagliflozin, 4) any DPP-4 inhibitor, GLP-1 agonist or other select AHA, 5) any DPP-4 inhibitor, GLP-1 agonist, TZD, SU, insulin or other select AHAs } and amongst new users of empagliflozin or dapagliflozin vs. new users of {1) any DPP-4 inhibitor, GLP-1 agonist or other select AHA, 2) any DPP-4 inhibitor, GLP-1 agonist, TZD, SU, insulin or other select AHAs} for patients with T2DM, overall and in the subpopulation with established cardiovascular diseases. We will perform clinical characterization to descriptively summarize and compare the exposure populations, and perform population-level effect estimation analyses for comparative effectiveness and safety.
