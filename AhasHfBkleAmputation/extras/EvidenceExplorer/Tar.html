<p>We will apply six time-at-risk definitions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The primary time-at-risk will be defined as the '<strong>on treatment</strong>' period, defined as the time from 1 day after exposure cohort start date (based on the date of first exposure to the cohort-defining drug(s)) to 0 days from exposure cohort end date, where exposure cohort end date was defined as the persistent period of exposure, allowing for 30 day gap between successive exposures until the final exposure record, representing the date the subject expected to finish the supply of the last drug dispensing per the prescription information.  The exposure cohort end date may be censored by the start of a drug era for a non-metformin AHA other than the cohort defining drug(s).</li>
<li>A secondary time-at-risk definition will be an '<strong>intent-to-treat</strong>' (ITT) period, defined as the time from 1 day after exposure cohort start date (based on the date of first exposure to the cohort-defining drug(s)) to all days from exposure cohort start date, which will be the end of the patient's observation period for which the exposure cohort start date occurred.</li>
<li>An additional sensitivity analysis will be performed using an 'on treatment with delayed induction and delayed <strong>lag</strong>' period, defined as the time from 60 days after the exposure cohort start date to 60 days after the exposure cohort end date, where exposure cohort end date was similarly defined as in 1) above.</li>
<li>Another sensitivity analysis will be performed using a '<strong>modified ITT</strong>' period, defined as the time from 1 day after exposure cohort start date (based on the date of first exposure to the cohort-defining drug(s)) until the end of the patient's observation period for which the exposure cohort start date occurred for those persons who only qualify for the target or comparator cohort, and from 1 day after exposure start date of the first cohort entry until the date of the second cohort entry for those persons who qualify for both the target and comparator cohorts.</li>
<li>Another sensitivity analysis will be performed using a '<strong>on treatment (no censor at switch)</strong>' period, defined as the time from 1 day after exposure cohort start date (based on the date of first exposure to the cohort-defining drug(s)) to 0 days from exposure cohort end date, where exposure cohort end date was defined as the persistent period of exposure, allowing for 30 day gap between successive exposures until the final exposure record, representing the date the subject expected to finish the supply of the last drug dispensing per the prescription information.  The exposure cohort end date is not censored by the start of a drug era for a non-metformin AHA other than the cohort defining drug(s), meaning the patient is at risk during the entire time they are exposed to the cohort-defining drug even if they augment therapy with another treatment.</li>
<li>Another sensitivity analysis will be performed using a 'on treatment with delayed induction and delayed <strong>lag (no censor at switch)</strong>' period, defined as the time from 60 days after the exposure cohort start date to 60 days after the exposure cohort end date, where exposure cohort end date was similarly defined as in 5) above, whereby cohort end date represents the discontinuation of the target defining drug(s) without regard to if another non-metformin AHA in initiated during the period of exposure.</li>
</ol>
<p>
For all analyses, a qualifying person from an exposure cohort will contribute time-at-risk from the time-at-risk start date until some censoring event occurs.   For the 'on treatment' and 'intent-to-treat' analyses, time-at-risk start date is defined as the date of first exposure to the particular drug(s) in the database, where the exposure start is between 1April2013 and 15May2017; for the 'on treatment with delayed induction and delayed lag', the time-at-risk start date is defined as 60 days after the date of first exposure to the particular drug(s) in the database.  For the 'on treatment' period, the censoring event is the earliest of: 1) exposure cohort end date, as defined by the end of persistent period of exposure censored at the time of a drug era start for a non-metformin AHA other than the cohort-defining drug, and 2) observation period end date (which is defined by end of continuous insurance eligibility or death).  For the 'intent-to-treat' period, the censoring event is the observation period end date.  For the 'on treatment with delayed induction and delayed lag' period, the censoring event is the earliest of: 1) 60 days after the exposure cohort end date, and 2) observation period end date.  For the 'modified intent-to-treat' period, the censoring event is the earliest of 1) the observation period end date, and 2) the start of the cohort entry for the second of the target and comparator cohorts for those patients qualifying for both cohorts.  For the 'on treatment with no censoring at switch' period, the censoring event is the earliest of: 1) exposure cohort end date, as defined by the end of persistent period of exposure, and 2) observation period end date (which is defined by end of continuous insurance eligibility or death).  For the 'on treatment with delayed induction and delayed lag and no censoring at switch' period, the censoring event is the earliest of: 1) 60 days after the exposure cohort end date, defined by discontinuation of exposure to the cohort defining drug(s), and 2) observation period end date.  In all circumstances, a patient is not censored by experiencing hospitalization for other reasons.</p>
