This study will be conducted in four observational health databases:

<ol>
<li>Truven Health MarketScan&#8482; Commercial Claims and Encounters Database (CCAE)</li>
<li>Truven Health MarketScan&#8482; Medicare Supplemental and Coordination of Benefits Database (MDCR)</li>
<li>Truven Health MarketScan&#8482; Multi-state Medicaid Database (MDCD)</li>
<li>OptumInsight's de-identified ClinformaticsTM Datamart, Extended - Date of Death (Optum)</li>
</ol>

Estimates across databasess will be combined using two meta-analysis methods, both assuming random effects:

<ol>
<li>Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman (HKSJ)</li>
<li>DerSimonian and Laird (DL)</li>
</ol>

Each database and meta-analysis method is described below:

<h4>1.	Truven Health MarketScanTM Commercial Claims and Encounters Database (CCAE)</h4>
<p>CCAE is a medical and drug insurance claims database of unique de-identified patients that include active employees, early retirees, COBRA continuers, and their dependents insured by employer-sponsored plans. The database contains inpatient admission records, outpatient services, prescription drugs, populations, eligibility status, and costs of services.</p>
<p>As of 13 February 2018 (data lock on version CDM_Truven_CCAE_v656), the latest available version of CCAE contains more than 136 million patients with observations from January 2000 through July 2017. The major data elements contained within this database that will be used within this analysis include: outpatient pharmacy dispensing claims which provide dispensing date, National Drug Code (NDC) to identify the prescription product, days supply, and quantity; inpatient and outpatient medical claims which provide service date, procedure codes (coded in CPT-4, HCPCS, ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-PCS), and diagnosis codes (coded in ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM); and enrollment records which provide the dates of insurance eligibility, as well as year of birth and sex. The database does contain selected laboratory test results (those sent to a contracted third-party laboratory service provider) for a non-random sample of the population, but this data will not be used within these analyses. As an administrative claims database, records may exist for each reimbursement transaction, such that it is possible for the database to document multiple drugs, diagnoses, and procedures during inpatient and outpatient medical services for a given person over time, during the enrollment period. Claims submitted using the CMS-1500 form are limited to 12 diagnoses per claim. A person may experience discontinuation in their eligibility within the same database and the same database may contain observations during multiple discontinuous periods of time for a given individual.</p>
The following limitations of Truven CCAE should be noted:
<ul>
<li>The commercially insured patients represent a higher socioeconomic status than the overall US population.</li>
<li>Data are based on financial claims filed for reimbursement; disease coding may reflect financial incentives for reimbursement rather than clinically and systematically verified definitions.</li>
<li>Prescriptions are those filled at outpatient pharmacies, not those prescribed or administered within inpatient services. The extent to which prescribed records went unfulfilled is not known. It is also not known whether medications were actually taken as directed, although repeated dispensing of the same drug would suggest that this is the case.</li>
<li>There is a data lag; Truven only sends records that are 100% paid, which can take about 6 months after year end.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.	Truven Health MarketScanTM Medicare Supplemental and Coordination of Benefits Database (MDCR)</h4>
<p>MDCR is an administrative health claims database for Medicare-eligible active and retired employees and their Medicare-eligible dependents from employer-sponsored supplemental plans (predominantly fee-for-service plans). Only plans where both the Medicare-paid amounts and the employer-paid amounts were available and evident on the claims were selected for this database. MDCR captures person-specific clinical utilization, expenditures, and enrollment across inpatient, outpatient, and prescription drug. It also includes results for outpatient lab tests processed by large national lab vendors.</p> 
<p>As of 13 February 2018 (data lock on version CDM_Truven_MDCR_v657), the latest available version of MDCR contains more than 9.8 million patients with observations from January 2000 through July 2017. The major data elements contained within this database that will be used within this analysis include: outpatient pharmacy dispensing claims which provide dispensing date, National Drug Code (NDC) to identify the prescription product, days supply, and quantity; inpatient and outpatient medical claims which provide service date, procedure codes (coded in CPT-4, HCPCS, ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-PCS), and diagnosis codes (coded in ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM); and enrollment records which provide the dates of insurance eligibility, as well as year of birth and sex. The database does contain selected laboratory test results (those sent to a contracted third-party laboratory service provider) for a non-random sample of the population, but this data will not be used within these analyses. As an administrative claims database, records may exist for each reimbursement transaction, such that it is possible for the database to document multiple drugs, diagnoses, and procedures during inpatient and outpatient medical services for a given person over time, during the enrollment period. Claims submitted using the CMS-1500 form are limited to 12 diagnoses per claim. A person may experience discontinuation in their eligibility and the database may contain observations during multiple discontinuous periods of time for a given individual.</p>
The following limitations of MDCR should be noted:
<ul>
<li>The commercially insured patients represent a higher socioeconomic status than the overall Medicare population.</li>
<li>Exact birth date is not available, only year of birth.</li>
<li>Data based on financial claims filed for reimbursement, disease coding may reflect financial incentives for reimbursement rather than clinically and systematically verified definitions.</li>
<li>Prescriptions are those filled, not those prescribed. We do not know the universe of prescribed records that went unfulfilled.</li>
<li>There is data lag, MarketScan only sends records that are 100% paid, which can take about 6 months after year end.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3.	Truven Health MarketScanTM Multi-state Medicaid Database (MDCD)</h4>
<p>MDCD contains the pooled healthcare experience of Medicaid enrollees from multiple states. MDCD includes medical claims from inpatient and outpatient services and prescription drug claims, as well as information on enrollment, long-term care, and other medical care.</p> 
<p>As of 13 February 2018 (data lock on version CDM_Truven_MDCD_v635), the latest available version of MDCD contains more than 25.5 million patients with observations from February 2006 through December 2016. The major data elements contained within this database that will be used within this analysis include: outpatient pharmacy dispensing claims which provide dispensing date, National Drug Code (NDC) to identify the prescription product, days supply, and quantity; inpatient and outpatient medical claims which provide service date, procedure codes (coded in CPT-4, HCPCS, ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-PCS), and diagnosis codes (coded in ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM); and enrollment records which provide the dates of insurance eligibility, as well as year of birth and sex. The database does not contain any laboratory test results. As an administrative claims database, records may exist for each reimbursement transaction, such that it is possible for the database to document multiple drugs, diagnoses, and procedures during inpatient and outpatient medical services for a given person over time, during the enrollment period. Claims submitted using the CMS-1500 form are limited to 12 diagnoses per claim. A person may experience discontinuation in their eligibility and the database may contain observations during multiple discontinuous periods of time for a given individual.</p>
The following limitations of MDCD should be noted:
<ul>
<li>No state information is available.</li>
<li>Exact birth date is not available, only year of birth.</li> 
<li>Lab tests processed by large national lab vendors are not available for MDCD patients.</li>
<li>Members eligible for Medicare may have incomplete data.</li> 
<li>Data based on financial claims filed for reimbursement, disease coding may reflect financial incentives for reimbursement rather than clinically and systematically verified definitions.</li> 
<li>Prescriptions are those filled, not those prescribed. We do not know the universe of prescribed records that went unfulfilled.</li>
</ul>

<h4>4.	OptumInsight's de-identified ClinformaticsTM Datamart, Extended - Date of Death (Optum)</h4>
<p>Optum is an administrative health claims database for members of United Healthcare, who are fully insured in commercial plans or in administrative services only (ASOs) and commercial Medicare. For each group, only members with both medical and prescription drug coverage are included. Optum captures person-specific clinical utilization, expenditures, and enrollment across inpatient, outpatient, and prescription drug, and includes results for outpatient lab tests processed by large national lab vendors (about 30% of the population). </p>
<p>As of 13 February 2018 (data lock on version CDM_Optum_Extended_DoD_v654), the latest available version of Optum contains more than 80 million patients with observations from June 2000 through June 2017. The major data elements contained within this database that will be used within this analysis include: outpatient pharmacy dispensing claims which provide dispensing date, National Drug Code (NDC) to identify the prescription product, days supply, and quantity; inpatient and outpatient medical claims which provide service date, procedure codes (coded in CPT-4, HCPCS, ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-PCS), and diagnosis codes (coded in ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM); and enrollment records which provide the dates of insurance eligibility, as well as year of birth and sex. The database does contain selected laboratory test results (those sent to a contracted third-party laboratory service provider) for a non-random sample of the population, but this data will not be used within these analyses. As an administrative claims database, records may exist for each reimbursement transaction, such that it is possible for the database to document multiple drugs, diagnoses, and procedures during inpatient and outpatient medical services for a given person over time, during the enrollment period. Claims submitted using the CMS-1500 form are limited to 12 diagnoses per claim. A person may experience discontinuation in their eligibility and the database may contain observations during multiple discontinuous periods of time for a given individual.</p> 
The following limitations of Optum should be noted:
<ul>
<li>Family enrollment, capitated plan information and exact birth date are not available.</li>
<li>All claims are limited to first 5 diagnostic codes.</li>
<li>Data based on financial claims filed for reimbursement, disease coding may reflect financial incentives for reimbursement rather than clinically and systematically verified definitions.</li> 
<li>Prescriptions are those filled, not those prescribed. We do not know the universe of prescribed records that went unfulfilled.</li>
</ul>
<p>All four databases have been standardized into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM), which includes a standard representation of health care experiences (such as information related to drug utilization and condition occurrence), as well as common vocabularies for coding clinical concepts and enables consistent application of analyses across multiple disparate data sources. Complete specifications for the extract, transform, and load (ETL) process for each database is available at: <a href="https://github.com/OHDSI/ETL-CDMBuilder">https://github.com/OHDSI/ETL-CDMBuilder</a>.</p>

<h4>Meta-analysis</h4>
<p>Meta-analysis across sources may offer increased precision for a composite estimate and, because of the differences in populations represented by the various data sources, will provide additional understanding of the study's external validity. Similarity of estimated associations across data sources will support broad applicability of findings. Heterogeneity of findings across data sources may indicate that associations between exposure and outcome vary according to patient characteristics. The consistency of study results will be quantified using the I2 statistic. If the degree of heterogeneity is acceptable (I2 &lt;40%), random-effects meta-analysis will be performed using both the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman (HKSJ) and DerSimonian and Laird (DL) methods.</p>
