The target cohort and comparator cohorts will be matched using variable ratio matching on the propensity, with a maximum ratio of 100 and using a caliper of 0.2 times the standard deviation of the logit of the propensity score distribution.  Propensity score stratification using 10 strata will also be used to construct matched sets.  The final outcome model will apply a Cox proportional hazard model conditioned on the matched sets.
