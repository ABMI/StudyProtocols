<p>Patients with an observed with an outcome prior to index exposure will be handled in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time-to-first-ever-event analysis:  This analysis will estimate hazards of first occurrence of outcome amongst patients with no history of the outcome.  Patients with the outcome, observed prior to target or comparator cohort entry will be excluded from consideration.</li>
<li>Time-to-first-post-index-event analysis:  This analysis will estimate hazards of an occurrence of outcome amongst all exposed patients, independent of prior outcome history.  Patients with no history of the outcome will be followed during the time-at-risk until observed a first occurrence of event; patients with a prior history of the outcome will be followed during the time-at-risk until observing the first recurrent event that occurs after the exposure index date.</li>
