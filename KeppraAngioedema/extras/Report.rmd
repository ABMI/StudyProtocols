# Introduction

This reports describes the results from a comparative effectiveness study comparing new users of levetiracetam to new users of phenytoin. Propensity scores were generated using large scale regression, and one-on-one and variable ratio matching was performed. Effect sizes were estimated using a univariate Cox regression, conditioned on the matched sets. A set of negative control outcomes was included to estimate residual bias and calibrate p-values.

## Analysis variations

In total, 8 analysis variations were executed:

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
    for (analysisId in analysisIds) {
        cat(paste0(analysisId, ". ", results$analysisDescription[results$analysisId == analysisId][1], "\n"))
    }
```

# Model diagnostics

## Propensity score distribution

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 6.5, fig.height= 5, fig.cap = "Propensity score distribution plot. This plot shows the propensity score distribution using the preference score scale."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(exportFolder, "PsPrefScale.png"))
```

## Covariate balance

### After one-on-one matching

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height= 5, fig.cap = "Balance scatter plot. This plot shows the standardized difference before and after matching for all covariates used in the propensity score model."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(exportFolder, "tablesAndFigures", "BalanceScatterPlot1On1Matching.png"))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 7, fig.height= 5, fig.cap = "Balance plot for top covariates. This plot shows the standardized difference before and after matching for those covariates with the largest difference before matching (top) and after matching (bottom). A negative difference means the value in the treated group was lower than in the comparator group."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(exportFolder, "tablesAndFigures", "BalanceTopVariables1On1Matching.png"))
```

### After variable ratio matching

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height= 5, fig.cap = "Balance scatter plot. This plot shows the standardized difference before and after matching for all covariates used in the propensity score model."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(exportFolder, "tablesAndFigures", "BalanceScatterPlotVarRatioMatching.png"))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 7, fig.height= 5, fig.cap = "Balance plot for top covariates. This plot shows the standardized difference before and after matching for those covariates with the largest difference before matching (top) and after matching (bottom). A negative difference means the value in the treated group was lower than in the comparator group."}

## Kaplan-Meier plots

### Per-protocol analysis

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height= 4, fig.cap = "Kaplan-Meier plot. Shaded areas indicate the 95% confidence interval. Note that this plot does not take into account conditioning on the matched sets, as done when fitting the Cox model."}

```

### Intent-to-treat analysis

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height= 4, fig.cap = "Kaplan-Meier plot. Shaded areas indicate the 95% confidence interval. Note that this plot does not take into account conditioning on the matched sets, as done when fitting the Cox model."}
