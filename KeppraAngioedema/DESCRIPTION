Description: This study aims to evaluate angioedema risk in seizure disorder
    patients exposed to Keppra (levetiracetam) compared with those exposed to
    phenytoin sodium. A potential link between levetiracetam and angioedema has
    been recently raised by the Food and Drug Administration in their review
    of spontaneous reporting data. In this study, we will analyze data from a
    distributed network using the OHDSI CohortMethod package.
